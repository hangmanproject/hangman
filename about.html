          <p class="description">Cookie Monster (aka Claire) is a Muppet on the long-running children's television show Sesame Street. She is best known for her voracious appetite and her famous eating phrases, such as "Me want cookie!" "Me eat cookie!" and "Om nom nom nom" (said through a mouth full of food). She often eats just about anything, including ice cream, hot dogs, cake, pizza, doughnuts, lettuce, apples, bananas, watermelon, as well as normally inedible objects. However, as her name suggests, her preferred food is cookies. Chocolate chip cookies are his favorite kind; oatmeal cookies are his second favorite. In a song in 2004, Cookie Monster revealed that, before she ate her first cookie, she believed her name was Sid (Wikipedia).</p>

        <h2>The History and Facts of Hangman</h2>
      </br>
        <ul id="lore">
          <li>The rules are simple; a player writes down the first and last letters of a word for another player guesses the letters in between.</li>
          <li>"As with many games which demand so much practice and preparation, pre-game rituals are a common occurrence for Hangman players. A variety of line-drawing, letter-guessing and eyeball posturing techniques are practiced in preparation for the big game." -Josh Goodall from The Board Game Geek.</li>
          <li>"One of Hangman’s most famous Guessers, Hignan von Shupack, spent years perfecting the triple-dosed-stare. When he finally chose to unleash it at the Northern Ireland Noose Necktie Yearly (NINNY) Championships against amateur Hangman Yuri Glavin; the poor Norwegener had no choice but to fill in the remaining spaces himself or risk implosion." -Josh Goodall from The Board Game Geek.</li>
          <li>For some odd reason, many schools and teachers prefer to use a tree with ten apples instead of using the hanging man."</li>
          <li>"The origins of Hangman are obscure meaning not discovered, but it seems to have arisen in Victorian times," says Tony Augarde, author of The Oxford Guide to Word Games.</li>
          <li>The game is mentioned in Alice Bertha Gomme's "Traditional Games" in 1894 under the name "Birds, Beasts and Fishes."</li>
          <li>"Like other world-famous sports and games, Hangman is not without its vices. In the early 2000’s, the World Hangman Activation Probe (WHAP) was commissioned with the sole intent to uncover the doping scandal that had taken the game by storm. With the exposure of Shirtless Joe Jackson’s close friendship with now-incarcerated gambler Lenny “the Lip” Mofusen, the atrocities committed behind the scenes could be ignored no longer. Hangman’s Governing Board faced expulsion and a potential 5-year competitive ban for the Hangman game. Were it not for the now World-Famous Puerto Rico slave/colonist debate in what is considered by many the greatest game ever, Hangman could not have survived the harsh media attention. With the spotlight now moved on, Hangman wasted no time addressing the scandals before further penalties were levied." -Josh Goodall from The Board Game Geek.</li>
